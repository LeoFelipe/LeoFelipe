## 👨‍💻 About Me

I’m a Senior Backend Engineer focused on building systems that **evolve safely, scale sustainably, and reduce operational risk**.

My work goes beyond writing code — I design software with explicit architectural boundaries, aiming to:

- Reduce **blast radius**
- Improve **lead time and deploy confidence**
- Lower cognitive load within teams
- Enable safe and continuous evolution

I treat modernization not as a version upgrade, but as a **strategic engineering capability**: increasing a system’s capacity to change with less friction and less risk.

## 🧠 Engineering Principles

Strong systems are built around intentional design decisions:

- 🔹 Clear separation between domain core and infrastructure  
- 🔹 Hexagonal Architecture (Ports & Adapters) principles  
- 🔹 Clean Architecture layering  
- 🔹 Explicit domain modeling (DDD)  
- 🔹 Event-driven boundaries and asynchronous communication  
- 🔹 Measurable engineering outcomes (Lead Time, MTTR, Deploy Frequency)

Architecture, to me, is not about patterns —  
it’s about enabling safe change over time.

## 🔨 Highlight Project

### 🛒 Ecommerce Portfolio (Distributed Modular Monolith)

🔗 https://github.com/LeoFelipe/my-ecommerce-portfolio

A production-inspired .NET solution designed to simulate enterprise architecture challenges.

### What it demonstrates

- ✔ Bounded Contexts (Orders, Carts, Payments, Deliveries)  
- ✔ Clean + Hexagonal architecture boundaries  
- ✔ Domain Events & Eventual Consistency  
- ✔ Asynchronous messaging with RabbitMQ + MassTransit  
- ✔ Functional testing with Testcontainers (PostgreSQL, MongoDB, Redis, RabbitMQ)  
- ✔ Realistic development workflow & environment orchestration  
- ✔ Observability via .NET Aspire  

This project reflects how I approach system evolution, boundary enforcement, and architectural discipline in real-world scenarios.
